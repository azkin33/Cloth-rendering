# Cloth-rendering

I haven't tried on Linux but make and ./main would run the program probably.
Nothing is required other than GLM,GLEW,GLFW
Keys you can use while trying the program:

A - Rotates the camera to left while looking the centeral cube.
D - Rotates the camera to right while looking the centeral cube.
G - Changes the rendering mode to GL_LINES.

By default, cloth is hanged using its 4 corners.

K - Hangs the cloth from 2 corners.
L - Drops the cloth.

R - Moves the cube forward
F - Moves the cube backward
P - Pauses
